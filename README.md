Most of the IP addresses provided by its users are exclusive as the reference resources that will help them download something from the network. Through client software, this torrent website enables its users to download their preferred files. When we say BitTorrent files, it refers to the tiny files that contain metadata. This metadata is essential for downloading data files.

## History of The Pirate Bay Network
As mentioned, this platform was founded and developed by Piratbryan, which represents The Piracy Bureau, a Swedish anti-copyright and pro-culture organization. According to the researchers, Fredrik Neij, Peter Sunde, and Gottfrid Svartholm are the first administrators who run the platform. Peter Sunde is also known to be a founder of the pirate bay.

Way back in September 2003, the creation of TPB was still unstructured. During that time, BitTorrent was considered only as a file-sharing technology. So developers determined to create a good working file-sharing platform. Initially, its main job is to allow the distribution of information and knowledge with ease.

Several months after the development of this software, Gottfrid Svartholm was hosting it in a Mexican-based company. Take note that he did it without the authorization of his co-founder Fredrik Neij. So, a Swedish appeal to the court to uphold the verdict in November 2010.

In 2004, The Pirate Bay established millions of users worldwide and shared more than 60,000 torrent files, magnet links, and information, more significant than what a 256 MB RAM capacity can hold.

With the increasing user base, the volume of copyrighted content on the network also increased. Currently, a torrent client can now download several files and content, including games, movies, files, applications, books, music, media, and many more, with ease and convenience. In 2009, the pirate bay founder was sentenced to one year in prison and fined to pay 30 million kronor around April.

Way back in December 2007, the site became a free and open-source platform. December 2010 was the time when the Swedish police seized the servers and their content. Every content you can find on the page has different seeders. So, if you want high-quality content, opt for the one with a good number of seeders to download files.

Around October of 2004, the Pirate Bay was considered a separate organization managed by Gottfrid. The said torrent site encountered several downtimes in October 2018. The activity level of the page was dropped down to 32 percent in October of the same year. Way back in November 2010, the tracker of the Pirate bay remains redundant. On December 19 of the same year, the Pirate bay came back online.

TPB had lots of happenings in December 2013. It gained several improvements. In December 2012, TPB changed and improved its homepage. Way back on December 8, 2014, most software related to TPB got removed in Google play. But TPB regained it. You may notice that most happenings in TPB happened in December in different years. The reason behind it is unknown.
